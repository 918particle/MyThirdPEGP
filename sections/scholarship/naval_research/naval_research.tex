\section{Collaborations with the Office of Naval Research}
\label{sec:naval_research}

During 2019-2020, it became clear that not only were missions to Antarctica postponed, but that progress in my field will only resume once the IceCube Gen2 design is finalized.

I have been awarded this ONR Summer Faculty grant

\subsection{Computational Electromagnetism and Open-Source Radar Design}
\label{sec:phased_array}

In Sec. \ref{sec:neutrino}, I described how \textit{phased arrays} will be useful for UHE-$\nu$ physics.

First, I believe my work represents the first time it has been shown MEEP can produce RF phased array designs.  

\subsection{3D Printing of RF Antennas}
\label{sec:3d_printer}

This summer, my ONR colleagues and my student, Adam Wildanger, and I have begun fabricating

\subsection{Applications to Mobile Broadband}
\label{sec:applications}

There are a variety of applications for this research.  Progress in high-gain ultra-wideband radar development is hindered because desireable parameters compete with each other.  The authors
