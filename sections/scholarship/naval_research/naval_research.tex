\section{Collaborations with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and NSWC Corona Division}
\label{sec:naval_research}

Running in parallel with my UHE-$\nu$ physics research has been a fruitful engineering collaboration with the US Navy.  There is a long history of engineering research performed through the national laboratory and armed service laboratory system and the physical sciences in academia.  The United States maintains strategic security by collaborating with engineering researchers, who in turn benefit via funding and collaborative opportunities that further research goals.  The research, in turn, benefits the people via technological breakthroughs.  One of the most famous examples is the Global Positioning System (GPS).  The connection to my UHE-$\nu$ research is that both the Navy and IceCube Gen2 require me to engage in RF engineering research.

In Sec. 8 of my prior PEGP, I wrote about the opportunity our collaboration with the US Navy represents for our students.  The collaboration is funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and takes place at a US Navy laboratory called NSWC Corona Division in Corona, CA.  The research has touched on radar and RF component design via computational electromagnetism (CEM), GPS modernization, RF field engineering training, and will in the future include reliability engineering and high-performance computing (HPC).  In Sec. \ref{sec:cem_paper}, I share how this collaboration has already produced award-winning research that has involved three different Whittier College undergraduates.  This research led to an invitation for me to speak at a national CEM conference at MIT\footnote{See supplemental material, and \url{https://news.mit.edu/2022/meepcon-comes-to-mit-0817}.}.  In Sec. \ref{sec:fellow}, I share how I have been helping NSWC Corona with workforce development using my teaching skills, and how the ONR Summer Faculty Research Program (SFRP) will boost our research in Summer 2024.  In Sec. \ref{sec:epa}, I share our plans to form a lasting partnership called an Educational Partnership Agreement with NSWC Corona, and the benefit to future engineering students at Whittier College.
