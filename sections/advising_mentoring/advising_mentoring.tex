\label{sec:advising_mentoring}

I reflect in this section on my role as an advisor and mentor.  On my role as an academic advisor, I highlight four themes in my reflections below.  (1) My ongoing participation in the Whittier Scholars Program is evidence that I am committed to interdisciplinary studies and the liberal arts.  (2) I have shown concrete examples of helping students broadening their vision to include new disciplines.  (3) The proportion of my students selecting ICS/Math and ICS/Physics continues to increase.  (4) According to the self-study completed by my department, I am responsible for a large portion of the first-year advising work my department contributes to the college.  It will be wise to rebalance that work, so I will likely reduce my first-year advising in the short term and increase advising of physical science and WSP majors.

In Tab. \ref{tab:advisees}, I summarize my advisees within the first-year orientation program, physical sciences, and Whittier Scholars Program.  After each entry, I indicate the outcome after their time at Whittier College, or their current job, or their plans upon graduation.  I have included my students in Physics Research (PHYS396), which is a course my department maintains to provide students 1-3 credits for doing research with us.  Though these credits do not count towards my teaching load, I provide these opportunities so that students can participate in my research and deepen their scientific and engineering toolkits.

\caption{\label{tab:advisees} A summary of my advisees, broken into three categories: first-year advisees, STEM majors, and WSP majors.  There are some first year advisees who have chosen ICS/Math for their major, for whom I remain a mentor.  One example is Emily List (ICS/Math '23).  Listed in the lower portion of the table are my PHYS396 - Physics Research students.}

\section{Advising First Year Students}

Reflecting on my time advising first-year students, I realize the first-year orientation and advising process has evolved substantially since I arrived in 2017.  During my second year serving the Enrollment and Student Affairs Committee (ESAC) with Prof. Gil Gonzalez, we discussed the INTD101 pilot program and I learned more about INTD100.  Since Prof. Gonzalez has fully implemented the INTD101 program, the orientation side of the process has been standardized, with course and curricular advising left to the professors.  I find it easier to understand my role within the new system.  It allows me more time to focus on the academics of my students, leaving orientation to campus to staff colleagues in CAAS, Wardman Library, and INTD101 content.  
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
Most of my first-year students decide upon a major program before arriving.  Because I am in the physical sciences, the system steers to me students who have declared a physical science major.  Occasionally, I encounter someone who is open to exploring programs before choosing a major.  When I encounter someone who is genuinely open, I first ask myself if Whittier Scholars is right for them.  The students I have encountered who thrive in WSP have a self-determination and willingness to act on their instincts.  Though I wish all of our students had these qualities, the added responsibility intrinsic to WSP is not for everyone.  We want our WSP advisees to genuinely take charge of the educational design, and think strategically about coursework and internships.  Some of my first year students simply want to begin a pre-designed major that suits their interests.  That being said, I do maintain a committment to the liberal arts and to interdisciplinary studies via WSP and advising.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
As evidence for this, I included the example of my student Wyatt Killien in my prior PEGP report (Secs. 5.1 and 5.2).  In our last communication you shared a concern that my advising is too ``rigid.''  I understand that to mean you do not want me to guide students down a pre-determined path, but foster a sense of exploration in areas other than STEM.  Usually, the orientation organizers direct first-year students interested in STEM subjects to me.  I do have the ability to recognize when a student needs to explore outside their initial plan.  Wyatt is a student who listed physics as the choice of major, but I detected that Wyatt was off-course after a few meetings.  The interest the student has in physics does not extend to the scientific mindset, but is more focused on the \textit{order} with which physics describes the Universe.  Wyatt is someone who is interested in science fiction, art and design, and manga and anime.  I recommended 100-level art and design course, and Wyatt joined them with enthusiasm and later changed his major.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
I have engaged in other advising moments with first-year students that caused them to expand their horizons, even if it did not benefit me or my department.  Recall that I taught a CON2 course INTD255 entitled ``Safe Return Doubtful: History and Current Status of Modern Science in Antarctica.''  Sophie Frizzell was my student in INTD255.  Sophie excitedly informed me in class this semester of her new career path in wildlife conservation after experiencing my teaching in INTD255.  Sophie has been working with an organization that protects and reintroduces infant elephant seals in Northern California.  INTD255 was heavily laden with lessons meant to inspire students to actively chart their own course as explorers.  Sophie is an example of a student who, after interacting with me, actively adjusted their educational trajectory to explore new worlds.  Another example of a student inspired by my teaching in a CON2 course is Scout Mucher, who recently graduated from Whittier College after taking my INTD290 course entitled ``History of Science in Latin America.''  After consultation with me, Scout decided to actually journey to Antarctica to work as a contractor to run McMurdo Station, the primary base of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).  To quote from my prior PEGP:

\begin{quotation}
Sometimes the interests of the student align with my research, and sometimes they do not. I advise them nonetheless, and do my best to meet the student where they are to guide them forward.
\end{quotation}

\section{Advising and Mentoring Majors in Physics, ICS, and 3-2 Engineering}

About one-fifth of the students that eventually become my advisees plan to major in Physics, ICS, or 3-2 Engineering.  In our last communication, I shared a logical framework that informs my advising with these students in the form of a decision tree.  You shared a concern about the tree, and concerns that the use of social media tools like LinkedIn does not always help these students.
