The following is a reflection on the six main teaching activities I use in the physical sciences.  I also apply them, as appropriate, to my liberal arts courses and college writing seminar sections.  Each activity is derived from the over-arching principles of \textit{order} and \textit{shared meaning.}  However, I have chosen not to cover those principles in detail, since I have already shared that in Sec. 2.1 of my prior PEGP.  Instead, for each of my six main teaching activities, I briefly articulate how they flow from \textit{order} and \textit{shared meaning}.  Next, I answer the following four questions you posed.
\begin{itemize}
\item (a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?}
\item (b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?}
\item (c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you set for your courses?}
\item (d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''}
\end{itemize} 
After completing this exercise, I reflect potential changes going forward, and what seems to work well.  One interesting shift that has taken place within our department is the use of \textit{online laboratory activities.}  I reflect on \textit{why} we have included this practice in recent years.

\subsection{General Approach: How I Teach with Six Easy Pieces (1-6)}

I begin by reflecting on my teaching philosophy for introductory physics courses.  The most succinct expression of my teaching philosophy may be broken into the six main teaching activities, or ingredients, below.  I consider each of them to be an active learning technique, ways of keeping students engaged in the processes of science throughout class sessions.  As I shared in Sec. 2.1 of my prior PEGP, physicists tend to classify students into \textit{majors} and \textit{non-majors}.  The broadest definition of a \textit{major} student is someone who takes physics or engineering courses above the introductory level.  Most physics education research (PER) covers courses designed for \textit{non-majors}.  PER provides empirical evidence for \textit{why} active learning techniques are effective.  Most students who take physics and engineering courses at Whittier College are non-majors.  Thus, most of the energy I devote to my teaching philosophy focuses on active learning techniques.  When I teach advanced courses, I remix the same ingredients into a different recipe.  Advanced physics and engineering courses are built from introductory ones, so students in those courses have already experienced ingredients (1-6) and are ready for something new.  When I teach liberal arts courses and sections of college writing seminar, I use a subset of activities (1-6), augmented by writing assignments.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
I begin introductory course sessions with teaching activity (1): traditional lecture format.  I start with a warm-up exercise drawn from textbook readings assigned 1-2 days prior.  Before giving the solutions, I present a thorough agenda for the session.  I then solve the warm-ups as on the whiteboard, and build on them with more intricate examples and proofs of theorems.  Next, I usually proceed to ingredient (2): peer-instruction \cite{mazur2013peer}.  I pose conceptual multiple-choice questions to the students, based on activity (1).  Students record their anonymous answers electronically, and we view the answer distribution.  We discuss our responses as peers in small groups, and I help stuggling students to stimulate their thinking by re-phrasing the question or giving them clues.  The students respond again, and we move forward when a super-majority of the students get it right.  Next, we arrive at activity (3): PhET simulations.  As the systems we study grow more complex, it is useful to simulate them.  Physics education technology, or PhET \cite{phet}, consists of HTML5 applications designed using extensive PER.  I provide written activities the students complete while operating the simulation.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
I use the second half of our session to conduct a laboratory activity, ingredient (4).  We work as a team in our department to maintain consistent lab pedagogy and equipment.  The students complete labs that cover the same content presented in activities (1)-(3).  Sometimes activity (5) becomes possible, in which we cover lecture content that is testable in both a PhET and a lab.  We align theoretical predictions with simulation and lab experiment\footnote{Ideally, we would do this every time, but there are not yet PhET simulations for all labs.}.  The students perform activity (6) near the end of the semester, when they propose, build, execute, and present experiments as small groups to the class.  Though teaching activities (1)-(6) represent the \textit{average} recipe for my sessions, I do not repeat the exact same routine each day.  As a cookbook contains a diverse collection of healthy recipes using common ingredients, I mix these ingredients in new and interesting ways to maintain student engagement.

\subsection{(1) Traditional Lecture Format}

My reflections provide three facets \textbf{(i)-(iii)} that make traditional lecture useful for students. \textbf{(i)} Solving problems on the whiteboard \textbf{displays the components of physics} in step-by-step fashion.  These include variables, estimation, units, functions, algebra/calculus, solutions and graphs, and checking results by examining units, limiting cases, and symmetry.  Facet (i) is derived from the principle of \textit{order} because scientific statements about nature must be ordered using consistent terminology and mathematics. \textbf{(ii)} Traditional lecture gives the students \textbf{memorizable examples} that serve as concrete anchor points, a form of \textit{shared meaning}.  The anchors help to assure our mutual understanding of a system, and students use them to solve new problems with similar traits.  \textbf{(iii)} By \textbf{linking basic examples together}, students begin to solve harder problems for more complex systems.  Complex physical systems in physics may be reduced to sub-systems we already understand.  Students learn to use the intrinsic \textit{order} of physics to model complex systems.  We know from PER that active learning strategies benefit the students, but students always request some traditional lecture content.  Philosophically, I make the facets of my traditional lecture as active as possible to maximize student engagement while affirming the needs of the students.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (i): displaying the components of physics problem solving.}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?}  As with any subject, students must first understand how to use its components before solving problems or creating something new using those components as one.  One example that arises every Fall semester in my courses is the usage of physical units with variables.  If the students are solving for the final speed of a system, some will write ``the final speed is 12.''  My next question is always ``twelve what? Kilometers per hour, feet per second ...'' Students become aware that there are components of physics calculations they do not yet understand when I break a problem into its components.  Once students master concrete examples by following my lead, they can adapt them to model similar systems.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?} While traditional lecture content is considered old-fashioned in PER, solving a problem with nothing but a piece of chalk in front of a group of students will always have a place in my teaching.  The students engage on their own with a written warm-up before examining the components of the solution on the baord.  This activity becomes for the students an anchor point that can be copied and studied.  This technique keeps traditional lecture \textit{active}, as the student evaluate the steps of their solution against mine.  I control the \textit{pace} of this content to maximize the learning of a diverse group of students.  This technique also boosts equity, in that we solve the same problem as one group and share the solution on a warm-up form that the students study with each other\footnote{\textit{Passive} traditional lecture content, in which the instructor simply works a few examples and then moves on, can actually reduce equity.  Students already familiar with the content will excel, whereas students with no prior experience will fall behind.}.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you set for your courses?} Two relevant learning goals\footnote{Learning goals are always listed in my course syllabi.  See supplemental material for details.} set for my recent two-semester sequence of algebra-based physics are (A) To solve word problems pertaining to physics and mathematics, and (B) to construct mathematical models of mechanical systems.  Facet (i) of traditional lecture addresses (A) by breaking down a word problem into its components, while translating the words into mathematical statements.  This is especially useful for students who grew up in a bilingual setting.  Facet (i) of traditional teaching addresses (B) because I demonstrate how harder problems can be broken into more manageable components.  By keeping this technique \textit{active}, the students are more engaged, and they all share the same understanding (shared meaning) of the problem by the end of the tutorial.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''}  The most basic reason that comes to mind is that the students ask for it.  It's concrete, and feels right to them.  Even if more modern PER methods are shown to be effective, I have learned that a course with too little of facet (i) is disorienting to learners.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (ii): memorizable examples.}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?} On a basic level, the learning process includes memorization and repetition, similar to the way a new student of music or a new language learns.  Compare the way someone who speaks English begins to learn Spanish, as opposed to \textit{linguistics}.  Memorization and repetition plays a stronger role in the former.  Compare a new student of the guitar learns music to a student of \textit{musical theory.}  Repetition and memorization again play a stronger role in the former.  Introductory physics students have a similar experience: active learning techniques involving repetition and memorization are useful in the beginning.  Once students overcome anxieties with solving physics problems, they gain enough confidence to engage with more complex physical systems.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?}  At a minimum, once per class session, I provide a written handout (the warm up problems) that I solve after the students have attempted them on their own.  The students then have completed document of example problems to study.  I deliberately select problems for homework and exams that share some connection to the example base I have built with the students.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you set for your courses?}  Facet (ii) addresses learning goal (A) above by demonstrating specifically how the words of a problem lead to the actions we take to solve it with mathematical reasoning.  When examples are memorized, problems involving similar logical language with different numbers can be solved with ease\footnote{Sometimes such collections of word problems are called ``homomorphic.''}.  Facet (ii) addresses learning goal (B) by providing providing memorizable models of simple systems that can be combined to build mathematical models (see also facet (iii)).
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''} In a practical sense, the fact I make these examples memorizable for the students helps them complete their homework, and to study for exams.  Their confidence, and the equity of the class, are boosted.  I recall a time I saw my student Deninson Cortez-Cruz stapling together all of my warm up problems.  I remarked that it looked like his studying was going well, and he replied: ``Oh yes, professor.  This packet is like our Bible.''  I smiled, because I knew that he was going to use those resources to help his lab group ace the class, and they all did.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (iii): linking basic examples together}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?} One obvious part of the learning process for technical subjects is that an understanding of complex systems comes after understanding simpler ones.  For example, suppose I have already covered the topics of \textit{friction} and \textit{momentum transfer}, with basic examples provided for each.  The students know how to predict the deceleration as the car slides against friction.  They also understand how to predict the velocities of objects that collide.  If I ask them to predict the final velocity of a vehicle \textit{struck by} another that had been sliding, facet (iii) is \textit{why} they can solve this problem.  The wrong approach would be to teach them about friction, then momentum transfer, and conclude that they should be able to solve the harder problem because they know the underlying concepts.  Rather, \textit{why} facet (iii) is so important is that the students actively learn how to couple simple ideas into complex ones.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?} Towards the end of traditional lecture time in class sessions, I occasionally link two basic examples or concepts together to solve a harder problem for the students.  When appropriate, I assign \textit{challenge problems} for bonus points that link together three or more basic concepts.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you set for your courses?}  One could argue that the purpose of facet (iii) is precisely to address learning goal (B): to construct mathematical models of mechanical systems.  This is a learning goal for all of the introductory physics courses, and it does not come easily to everyone.  Thus, take the time to practice it.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''}  I would compare this part of the process to a piano student first learning scales before beginning to compose songs.  Once students understand the \textit{order} built into physics, they trust that connecting simple models together to form complex ones is a strategy that works.  Though facet (iii) is the most challenging within traditional lecture, it is worth the payoff for the students because their problem-solving capability grows more powerful.

\subsection{(2) Peer-Instruction (PI)}

My reflections provide three facets \textbf{(i)-(iii)} that make peer-instruction useful for students.  Students must \textbf{(i) form an argument in their own scientific language}, which relates to the principle of \textit{order} because they order the concepts of physics in their minds to achieve this.  Students must then \textbf{(ii) practice explaining concepts to others.}  Peer-instruction naturally connects to \textit{shared meaning} via facet (ii).  Finally, peer-instruction enables \textbf{(iii) teaching efficiently.}  Peer-instruction has built-in pace control that keeps students engaged by covering lightly concepts the students understand well, while focusing more intentionally on concepts they find more challenging\footnote{I don't find that this benefit of peer-instruction relates to \textit{order} or \textit{shared meaning}, but it is important enough to include here.}.  These determinations are made empirically within the class session.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (i): forming an argument in one's own scientific language.}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?}  Causing a student to absorb abstract ideas in a way that they understand, and to confirm that understanding with peers, is critical to the learning process.  PI relies on short, conceptual word problems posed in a multiple choice format.  These problems reveal cases in which a student is getting correct answers but for the wrong reasons.  We ask the students to explain the problem to themselves in their own words while removing the added confusion of dealing with excessive numbers and formulas.  Practicing facet (i) of PI causes students to confront their lack of understanding of a concept, and to gain control over it in a way that is practical for them.  PI is an active learning technique, and facet (i) represents the starting point for the active learning.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?}  Since PI is such a well-studied technique in PER, I refer the reader to Appendix A, Sec. 7.2 of my prior PEGP, and the following book, website, and conference resource \cite{mazur2013peer,PhysPort,AAPTPI}.  The basic plan is to pose the problem, record anonymous student responses, display the response distribution, have a short group discussion with peers, and then respond again until a super-majority of students gets the problem right.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you set for your courses?}  The relevant learning goal (taken from my introductory course syllabi) is (C): to apply logical thinking to conceptually-posed physics problems.  Facet (i) of my PI modules serves to \textit{order} the concepts and problems in the minds of the students in a way that is the most useful for them.  The importance of this goal is that it serves the other goals (A) and (B).  Often, we observe introductory students mis-applying a physics equation to solve a problem because it is the only relevant formula they understand.  By practicing conceptual thinking, facet (i) helps break students out of this pattern and instead \textit{order} a problem conceptually in their minds before solving it algebraically.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''}  I hear the following sentence every single Fall semester in office hours: ``I understand the formulas and concepts in physics.  I just need help `translating' the problem into the formulas.''  Facet (i) is vital for the problem-solving growth of the students.  In the phase of PI where facet (i) is occurring, students discover that they are responsible for this ``translation,'' and their problem-solving skill grows through developing the habit of mentally translating the words of the problem into physics concepts.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (ii): practice explaining concepts to others} 
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?} Our own conceptual understanding of a concept must be confronted by the conceptual understanding of others (\textit{shared meaning}), and physical reality (\textit{order}).  The learning process for physics must include the chance to revise one's conceptual understanding by confronting faulty logic and absorbing the logic of others.  This process need not be confrontational, however, as in a debate or a sport.  Instead, facet (ii) of PI respects the basic psychology of learners: we are more likely to absorb the thinking of a trusted peer who uses language we already understand.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?}  See Appendix A, Sec. 7.2 of my prior PEGP, and the following book, website, and conference resource \cite{mazur2013peer,PhysPort,AAPTPI}.  I add here that, during the discussion (facet (ii)) phase of PI, I focus my attention on struggling students to help boost class equity.  In these side discussions, I listen to my students and share clues with them as their peer.  This technique requires a pre-established relationship of trust with the students, so early in the semester I focus more attention on building this relationship.  Getting to know the students more personally, and sharing common experiences often facilitates this type of learning.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you set for your courses?}  The purpose of facet (ii) of PI is literally to develop a \textit{shared meaning} between peers and instructors.  Learning goal (C) is directly addressed, and learning goals (A) and (B) are augmented.  Students begin to think more conceptually before solving problems algebraically rather than guessing the formula and plugging in numbers.  As an example, consider a student attempting to predict the final velocity of a falling object by plugging in the distance traveled divided by the time duration.  This is wrong, because the object is accelerating.  During group discussion, a lab partner might explain why the formula doesn't apply:  ``I don't think you can use that one. This one's more like the accelerating car where you have to times the acceleration by the delta-t.''  Once the two peer develop a shared understanding, they are more likely to get the problem right. 
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''} In summary, facet (ii) of PI is about confronting faulty logic surrounding physics concepts and modifying it through dialog with trusted peers.  I have noticed that my students naturally form peer groups in my courses.  This can take the form of teammates from varsity sports, friends in the same social society (e.g. Penns, Palmers), or bilingual students.  These connections tend to augment the mechanics of facet (ii) because lab group members are already friends and trust one another.  When there is a student that appears more solo to me, I gravitate towards that student during PI discussions.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (iii): teaching efficiently}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
This facet of PI does not flow neatly from my values of \textit{order} or \textit{shared meaning,} nor does it answer questions (a)-(d) directly.  Philosophically, I think of facet (iii) of PI as an auxiliary benefit that helps the students.  When a super-majority of students answer a conceptual question correctly in the first round, we move forward in the material.  When this does not happen, we stop and have group discussions.  This is a natural pace control mechanicsm that ensures we neither go too fast nor too slow.  To boost equity, as I've shared in prior PEGPs, I've built in the WAT function.  Students can hit a special button called WAT\footnote{\url{https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wat}.} that causes me to stop and give additional clues, regardless of the proportion of students who've solved the problem correctly.  Students know to hit WAT if they are majorly confused, and this is more rare than the sort of confusion that gets resolved in group discussions.

\subsection{(3) PhET Simulations}

Having reflected on my use of PhET simulations, I have found three facets (i)-(iii) that make them useful for my students. \textbf{(i) PhETs foster the extraction of patterns from physical systems} (\textit{order}).  The learning process involves pattern recognition, and PhETs provide a space for students to tinker with a system until they recognize the pattern. \textbf{(ii) PhETs provide an avenue for students to construct graphical results.} Data can be generated quickly and seamlessly with PhET simulations, because the confusions of building the apparatus and dealing with statistical error are gone.  Students can focus on plotting results in a way that the group understands (\textit{shared meaning}).  The third facet is philosophically practical: \textbf{(iii)} PhET simulations allow us \textbf{to study physical systems we cannot build.}  A common example is the topic the solar system, which we use to study gravity.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (i): extracting patterns from physical systems}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?} Part of the learning process in the physical sciences is to recognize patterns in systems (\textit{order}).  PhET simulations allow students to experiment more freely in the absence of statistical error.  For example, consider a DC circuit powered by a 5 Volt battery.  Students can measure instantaneously the current flowing to various devices in the circuit using a tool.  To graph the data and extract Ohm's law (a linear relationship between voltage and current), they simply tune the battery voltage.  In real life, the students would have to swap batteries, measure the voltage of each battery, and keep track of errors.  These experimental skills are also part of the learning process, but PhET simulations help students to concentrate on \textit{just the pattern recognition.}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?}  I incorporate PhET simulations as group activities completed by the usual lab groups within my integrated lecture-lab format.  I give the students a brief tutorial on the projector screen, and I provide them with a written worksheet.  Students work together to construct a model or experiment using the parts in the PhET, and use the model to produce graphical results recorded on the worksheet.  When appropriate, I construct my own version on the large screen, and we all compare results together (\textit{shared meaning}).
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you
set for your courses?}  Learning goals (A) and (B) are augmented indirectly, for the students are more likely to use a formula to solve a problem correctly if they have verified that formula experimentally.  Having extracted the pattern, they can replicate the pattern in other contexts.  Another learning goal is reached by the \textit{order} achieved through pattern recognition is (D) ``to practice scientific experimentation, data analysis, and reporting of results.''  Students must order their thinking by analyzing data and constructing graphical results as a small group in our PhET activities.  PhET simulations, however, are not the same as real-world lab experiments, which require (in addition) the ability to deal with equipment and perform error analysis.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''}  On a basic level, I include PhET simulations because they are based on extensive PER.  The appearance of the controls and equipment in the PhET programs feels simular to the real lab.  The measurement tools have obvious controls that can be learned quickly.  Once the students have done an experiment with a PhET simulation, doing the real version on the lab bench is more straightforward because they already understand the underlying pattern.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (ii): constructing graphical results}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?} Towards the end of the learning process in the physical sciences comes the ability to convince others of the validity of a concept or result (\textit{shared meaning}).  This is in addition to the ability to master a concept derived from experimentation well enough to apply it to word problems.  Facet (ii) of PhET activities is about creating a visual representation of experimental data such that another person can be expected to interpret the results and extract the same pattern as the experimenter.  Thus, the experimenter must think about the details of how results are communicated, and in turn, ask themselves if they really understand the results.  Thus, facet (ii) is a reflective part of the process.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?} Philosophically, I must strike a balance for facet (ii) of PhET.  I need to scaffold the graph on the PhET worksheet so that the students can fill in their data, leaving a proper graph that can be interpreted by peers.  On the other hand, I want the students to practice constructing the elements of a graph on their own.  These elements include labeled axes, legends, proper numerical upper and lower limits, and data points that include any statistical errors.  We build these skills over the course of the first semester, and our graphics gradually become more sophisticated.  My expectation for the self-designed final projects (see below) is that all results communicated graphically can be interpreted without ambiguity. 
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you
set for your courses?} Learning goal is (D) ``to practice scientific experimentation, data analysis, and reporting of results.''  The work we do with PhET in facet (ii) is all about reporting of results such that someone else could reasonably understand them (\textit{shared meaning}).  It is therefore a worthwhile skill to practice.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''}  On a basic level, I focus on facet (ii) of PhET because without it, science itself goes awry very fast.  Even though I might know how I arrived at my physical conclusions, if I cannot display them such that someone else draws those same conclusions, then I am not doing science.  Having practiced interpreting each other's graphs in my courses, our students are equipped with an important skill they will use immediately in the scientific and professional communities they join after they graduate.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (iii): studying systems we cannot build}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
A practical benefit of using PhET simulations is that we cannot always construct systems we would like to study.  Consider the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas.  The \textit{kinetic theory of ideal gases} tells us that the reason these macroscopic quantities are related is because ideal gases are made of molecules that all have kinetic energy and momentum.  Pressure is caused by molecules transferring momentum to vessel walls, temperature is related to the average kinetic energy (velocity) per molecule, and changes in vessel volume can be attributed to the molecules doing work on the vessel.  We would like to do some lab activity to help the students understand these concepts, but repeating ideal gas experiments done in chemistry courses would not demonstrate how these phenomena are caused by the \textit{molecules.}  A simulation is more illuminating and practical.

\subsection{(4) Laboratory Activities}

My reflections give three facets \textbf{(i)-(iii)} that make laboratory activities useful for students.  In a book we are reading for my current INTD100 section \cite{scientific_attitude}, the author draws the \textit{line of demarcation} between science not science with two ideas.  First, \textit{science cares about data.}  The data in question is data collected during a properly constructed experiment.  Second, \textit{science is willing to change theories based on new data.}  Thus, facet \textbf{(i)} of the laboratory pillar of my teaching philosophy is to show the students that \textbf{science cares about data} (\textit{shared meaning}).  Comparing data to theoretical prediction is the core of science.  However, raw data can be made to ``say'' anything if we fudge it enough.  Facet \textbf{(ii)} is about \textbf{learning to keep an experiment under control} (\textit{order}).  Students learn through controlled experimentation that IF they perform an experimental action and THEN the data responds accordingly, with no other factors being changed, the most convincing results are generated.  Finally, given that no experiment has infinite precision, facet \textbf{(iii)} is about \textbf{error analysis} (\textit{order}).
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Facet (i): science cares about data}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(a) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you describe your interpretation of the learning process?}  It might seem obvious that physical science courses need laboratory work.  However, some students, especially those who plan to major in more mathematically-oriented topics, tend to trust theoretical physics too much.  It is much more rare to encounter a student whose skepticism for the laws of physics is so strong only crystal-clear experiments can overcome it.  We perform experiments to provide the students with hard proof that what we are teaching them is real.  Facet (i) may or may not help with solving word problems.  But on a deeper level, the students see that physics is not folly, but built upon incontrovertible evidence.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(b) \textit{For this teaching activity, how do you incorporate teaching tools and practices?}  Constructing a good lab activity for physics courses is an art form\footnote{I am grateful to Prof. Lagan for taking time to help me grow in this area.}.  Design an apparatus that is too complex, and the students will learn nothing.  To simple, and the apparatus will not tell the students anything.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
c) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you show how the tenets of your teaching philosophy help achieve learning goals you
set for your courses?}
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
(d) \textit{For this teaching activity, can you focus on the ``why'' of specific teaching decisions, instead of ``how?''}
