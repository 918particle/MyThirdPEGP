\caption{\label{tab:classes} This table is a summary of courses taught in five years, plus Summer sessions.  Not included: PHYS396 (Physics Research for Credit), PHYS499 (Senior Seminar), and PHYS495 (Independent Studies).}
\end{table}

The data in Tab. \ref{tab:classes} are meant to share a portrait of my teaching over the last five years, not including Fall 2022.  Appropriate benchmarks in my department are to teach 20 credits per year, and I have hit 21 credits per year, without including physics and engineering research for credit (PHYS396).  Our average student-to-faculty ratio is 12, meaning my courses tend to have 6 or more students above average (18.6), or about a 55\% increase.  All of my courses are either 3 or 4 credits, excluding things like PHYS396 (variable 1-3).  The average is 3.6 credits per course, meaning a slight majority of my credits come from 4-credit courses.  This yields a students/credit ratio of 5.1, again indicating that I teach more students than most of our colleagues at Whittier.  For example, a standard 3.0 credit course with 12 students would have a students/credit ratio of 4.0.  A ratio of 5.1 indicates that I teach $\approx 20$\% more students/credit.  I have taught a mixture of introductory STEM courses, liberal arts courses, and advanced technical subjects.  About three quarters of my courses have not been advanced technical subjects.

In summary, I feel this represents a healthy mixture of teaching for an assistant professor at Whittier College.  I have not forgotten your suggestion to bring back my CON2 course about the history of science in Latin America.  This should take place after I return from sabbatical, should I be granted tenure.  I welcome any other suggestions you might have.
