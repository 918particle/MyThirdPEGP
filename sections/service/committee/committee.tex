In this section I reflect primarily on my service within the Educational Policy Committee.  Since I have been accepted onto the Whittier Scholars Program (WSP) Council, I also reflect on our plans to enhance WSP.  Finally, I offer some ideas on how I can serve the college in the future through institutional research.

\subsection{Educational Policy Committee}

Though the charge to EPC in AY 2021-2022 contained many projects and goals, none required as much energy and thorough deliberation as finishing the course system proposal.  I must be honest when I share my reflections on these experiences: they were challenging.  I trust you to read these reflections within the context of honest service rather than the outcome of the course system proposal.

When I joined EPC last Fall, I learned that the idea of switching Whittier College to a course system proposal had been around for at least 20 years.  As a curious scientist, I began to ask questions to learn the fundamental reasons why some of my colleagues had spent the better part of their careers advocating for the course system.  The most honest answer I can share with you is that, having served at a number of institutions\footnote{These include five institutions of higher education: Yale University, UC Irvine, University of Kansas, The Ohio State University, and Whittier College, plus three councils of the Knights of Columbus at three Catholic parishes.}, it felt no different than any other entrenched debate among colleagues that have served for many years at the same place.
