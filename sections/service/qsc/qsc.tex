In Spring 2022, I was recruited by Prof. Gil Gonzalez to serve in a group of colleagues whose goal is to create a Quantitative Success Center (QSC).  To say that Whittier College has struggled with student success in introductory math courses in recent years is an understatement.  I have been confronted in my years at Whittier with situations I did not know occurred in higher education.  A senior in algebra-based physics approached me mid-exam and asked ``what does solving for x mean?'' I witnessed a student fail College Algebra (MATH076) four times, \textit{and then} enroll in my Algebra-based Physics course.  I decided out of curiosity at the beginning of last semester to observe how MATH074 is taught, but I found every single chair empty and the instructor working on a laptop.

My teaching practice is always informed by equity, and I incorporate PER when I teach physics and mathematics.  I participated in three workshops on inclusion in introductory STEM courses (see Sec. \ref{sec:dei} below).  I wrote extensively about how I address classroom equity in my prior PEGP (see Sec. 2.2 of my prior PEGP).  I hope that I have earned some credibility within the area of teaching physical science courses to a diverse group of students with varying preparation.  So trust me when I share, in sincerity, how alarming and frustrating it is to hear the rhetoric some use to describe STEM.  As I was editing my DEI internal grant with IDC colleagues, some wrote the following:

\begin{quotation}
We do not see how, for example, a system designed by white men addresses the needs of students of color and women who are marginalized in STEM.
\end{quotation}

I was shocked to read that.  White professors are \textit{incapable} of helping students from a different background?  I chose to respond with logic:

\begin{quotation}
Consider a proof by contradiction: introductory STEM courses at Whittier College are ``systems'' often created by white men, so by this logic no students of color or female students should succeed in such courses.  But many do, as evidenced by course evaluation data and in our learning outcomes. If they did not, a large fraction of introductory physics students would fail.
\end{quotation}

I understand if you feel the need to lecture me about DEI, but keep in mind I have taught $\approx 500$ diverse STEM students here (in physics and math) and regularly attend workshops on how to teach them better.  The majority of my students in physics are students of color and young women\footnote{For this semester: 60\% people of color and 56\% young women in PHYS135A, and 64\% people of color and 55\% young women in PHYS150.}.  If I, a white man, am unable to address their needs, then a majority of my students should not succeed.  \textbf{The data demonstrates the exact opposite reality.} Anecdotally, my colleagues in my department also demonstrate success with diverse students.  The simplest explanation of the situation with introductory math is that has nothing to do with ``whiteness,'' but teaching style.  Anecdotally, my experiences with students and colleagues confirm that introductory math is taught differently than physics at Whittier.

As a pre-tenured faculty I cannot easily influence how my colleagues teach.  What \textit{might} influence how math is taught at Whittier College is a QSC focused on pedagogical practices that generate student success among a diverse student body.  To that end, I argued for including such qualities in the future QSC director.  Our group drafted with consensus a job description that called for the following characteristics: proven teaching experience in mathematics at the college level, knowledge of equitable teaching strategies, and experience in education management.  The latter is the most important, for the QSC director will be responsible for helping mathematics instructors become more successful.  These interactions will not be easy, but necessary for our students.  For my part, I plan to contribute to the QSC by giving lectures about the benefits of PER in mathematics instruction.  In my next PEGP report I look forward to sharing good news about progress with the QSC.
