In Sec. \ref{sec:qsc}, I wrote about the challenge we face with introductory mathematics instruction.  While I would love to help improve introductory math instruction, I have chosen to focus an internal DEI grant on introductory course I teach personally, in order to polish and test the central ideas.  Introductory physics courses serve large cohorts of diverse students and are required for many majors and professional schools.  These students share in course evaluations that they are usually nervous about taking physics.  Our goal is to develop a mobile application infused with machine-learning and educational data-mining (EDM) that will boost equity and inclusiveness in foundational physics courses.  Based on published examples developed at other institutions, we will create a
customized tool that will strengthen our studentsâ€™ skills and abilities. Diverse undergraduate experts in digital storytelling and design will drive and shape the digital presentation of content. Our application will include the voices, narrative themes, and imagery of the diverse students actually attending foundational physics courses. The result will be an open educational resource (OER) designed to foster equity and inclusion for Whittier College Physics students.
