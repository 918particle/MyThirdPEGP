As Whittier College moves forward from the pandemic that began two years ago, service to our college community has taken on new meaning.  Many of us have given more of ourselves to sustain Whittier College.  In AY 2021-2022, Prof. Andrea Rehn recommended me for the Whittier Scholars Program council.  I was, however, asked to volunteer for the Educational Policy Committee, because new members were needed to continue the work.  I decided to step up for Whittier and servce EPC.  In Sec. \ref{sec:committee_service}, I reflect on our accomplishments in EPC, and other committee service topics.  This Fall 2022 semester, I am again serving students in the INTD100 and orientation program.  I reflect on my INTD100 exeperiences in Sec. \ref{sec:first_year}.  In Spring 2022, I was asked to help with the formation of our new Quantative Success Center (QSC) (Sec. \ref{sec:qsc}).  Finally, I share in Sec. \ref{sec:dei} a service project to advance inclusion within our introductory STEM courses.
